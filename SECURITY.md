# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

SeaGOAT uses semantic release to automatically release new versions
automatically. Therefore there aren't multiple versions of SeaGOAT
simultaneously maintained and to have the most secure version, you should be
always using the latest version.

New versions are released automatically if one of SeaGOAT's dependencies
releases a security upgrade.
